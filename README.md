 To-Do List App
This is a simple and user-friendly **To-Do List App** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks, and it automatically saves the list to the browser's local storage so that tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

 Features:
- Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks via a text box and click the "Add" button to insert them into the list.
- Mark Tasks as Complete**: Clicking on a task will mark it as complete with a strikethrough effect.
- Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button (represented by "×") to remove it from the list.
- Local Storage**: The app saves tasks in the browser's local storage, so tasks are retained even when the page is refreshed.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structure of the app (file: `index.html`).
- CSS: Styling for a clean and modern look (file: `style.css`).
- JavaScript: Logic for adding, deleting, marking tasks as complete, and saving data to local storage (file: `script.js`).

How to Use:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Add a task by typing it into the input field and clicking "Add."
3. Click on tasks to mark them as complete or incomplete.
4. Click the "×" button next to a task to delete it.
5. The tasks will automatically be saved in local storage, so they will remain available even after refreshing the page.

Future Enhancements:
- Add categories for tasks.
- Implement task deadlines and reminders.
- Add task priority levels.
